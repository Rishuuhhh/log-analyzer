# Log Analyzer

## Status
Work in progress

## Description
This project is a Java-based application designed to analyze log files and extract meaningful information such as error frequency, request patterns, and summary statistics.
It focuses on building practical skills in file handling, data processing, and basic analysis commonly used in backend and system-level applications.

## Objectives
- Understand structured and unstructured log formats  
- Process large text files efficiently  
- Extract useful insights from log data  

## Planned Features
- Read and parse log files line by line  
- Identify log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR)  
- Count and summarize occurrences of events  
- Generate basic# Log Analyzer
